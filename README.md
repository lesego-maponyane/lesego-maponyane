## üìå Featured Projects 

These projects showcase a blend of data analysis, machine learning, and web development, highlighting my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights and engaging digital experiences. From predicting healthcare appointment no-shows to classifying South African languages, analyzing electrification projects, and building interactive websites, each project reflects hands-on problem-solving, creativity, and measurable impact.

Whether working with complex datasets, designing dashboards, or crafting responsive websites, I focus on delivering real results while making the work fun and meaningful. These experiences demonstrate not only technical skills but also an eagerness to tackle challenges that can make a tangible difference.

  ### 1. [Healthcare Appointment No-Show Analysis]
  - Built a classification model (Randon Forest + SMOTE) to predict patient no-shows
  - Created SQL queries for cohort segmentation
  - Designed a moch stakeholder dashboard (Power BI + Excel)
  - **Results:**  78% accuracy; identitfied top 3 risk factors; mock intervention could reduce no-shows by ~ 15%

  ### 2. [SA Language Hackathon]
  - Developed a machine learning model to classify South African languages from text to data. 
  - Preprocessed and engineered features from raw text, trained multiple models and evaluated performance.
  - **Outcome:**  Gained insights into language patterns and built a model with practical applications from NLP and localisation tools.
 
  ### 3. [Eskom Electrification Analysis]
  - Analysed electrification project data to track progrss, identify bottlenecks and optimise resource allocation. 
  - Used SQL and Excel to generate actionable insights for project teams.
  - **Impact:** Provided clear KPIs and recommendations to improve project efficiency and ensure timely electricity delivery. 
 
  ### 4. [Pine City Zoo Website]
  - Built a responsive website with HTML, CSS and Javascript
  - Showcases creativity in front-end design and usabiloty.
